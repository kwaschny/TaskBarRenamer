# TaskBarRenamer
Taskbar Renamer (TBRN) allows you to rename the window title of any running application. This is useful when running multiple instances of an application where the application does not have unique window titles (caption) on the Windows taskbar. With the help of TaskBarRenamer you can easily rename each application's window title individually to distinguish between all running instances. This does not affect the application itself but the appearance only and thus is safe to use. TBRN is also able to detect applications automatically and rename them as soon as they are running. TaskBarRenamer is a handy tool you should work with if you need to run many programs simultaneously.

I made this back in 2009/2010 for personal use and decided to share it.
